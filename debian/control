Description: development files for libbitcoin
 libbitcoin is a bitcoin library targeted towards high end use. The library
 places a heavy focus around asychronicity. This enables a big scope for
 future scalability as each component has its own thread pool.
 By increasing the number of threads for that component the library is able
 to scale outwards across CPU cores. This will be vital in the future as
 the demands of the bitcoin network grow.
 .
 Another core design principle is libbitcoin is not a framework, but a
 toolkit. Frameworks hinder development during the latter stages of a
 development cycle, enforce one style of coding and do not work well with
 other frameworks. By contrast, libbitcoin functions as an independent set
 of mutual components with no dependencies between them.
 .
 This package provides the development files (ie. includes, static library),
 that allow to build software which uses libbitcoin.
