/// catch and squash. If an external API throws unepxectedly, our pervasize use
/// of NOEXCEPT will cause a call to std::terminate.

/// We throw for istream >> read failures, given the nature of streams.

/// We throw for division by zero and other basic math parameterization errors
/// because the functions are public and are otherwise unguarded. When calling
/// them internally we first verify parameters to prevent hitting the exception.
/// This behavior is no different than when using C++ math operators directly.

/// We do not generally catch or throw for out of memory conditions as they are
/// pervasive and it would be impractical to attempt to inject an allocator for
/// all possible external API memory allocations. Long term objective: inject
/// all allocation.
