// This is NOT an implementation of RFC 4648: tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648
// This is a generic data-text encoder fully compliant with the data
// conversion aspect of BIP713. However, unlike BIP173 this is entirely
// decoupled from bitcoin semantics. BIP173 requires version and checksum
// incorporation, fed into an internal stage of encoding. This makes unusable
// for general purpose encoding (and complex to work with even in bitcoin).

// BIP173 actually specifies two mappings. One is this base32 and the other
// is a numeric expansion with that can be mapped to and from base32 characters
// by holding the index offset of those characters. This is also base 32 but it
// is not a texual encoding. Instead it is a simple expansion of the original
// data to 5 bits per byte. This would be inconsequential but for the BIP173
// specification that bitcoin segregated witness script version and checksum
// be written directly to the expanded encoding. These elements must be injected
// into and extracted from the intermediate stage of the base32 encoding.

// For these reasons we provide bech32_build_checked and bech32_verify_checked
// functions as a bridge for base32 for those working with witness addresses.
// These are implemented using the base32_unpack and base32_pack functions
// here. These expose the internal expand/contract stages of base32
// encode/decode, but are not necessary given the bech32 checked functions.
// The expand/contract functions here are exposed for implementation of the
// bech32 checked functions and for testing and are otherwise unnecessary.

// BIP173 address test vectors do not round trip here, even with the prefix and
// separator charactors removed. The prefix and checksum are injected into the
// expanded representation, which is internal to this base32 encoding. The
// injection appears as base32, but is non-standard base32 encoding. The BIP173
// data value must be compressed from the checked expansion before encoding
// as base32, and must be unchecked to parse data values after base32 decoding.
// In this implementation any encoded value that was created by encode_base32
// will be returned by decode_base32. Arbitrary encoding characters will decode
// but may not round trip (as is the case with BIP173 address encoding).
